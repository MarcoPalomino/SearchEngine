# SearchEngine

It is a C# console solution that performs a search engine using the most common search libraries, such as

* Google
* Yahoo
* Bing (Under construction yet)

The purpose of the console application is to show the different mechanisms for getting the total of ocurrences regarding a word provided using the current SDKs available.

As I mentioned, the Bing search engine is under construction yet.
